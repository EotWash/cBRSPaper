abstract = "Thin superconducting films are predicted to be highly reflective mirrors for gravitational waves at microwave frequencies. The quantum-mechanical non-localizability of the negatively charged Cooper pairs, which is protected from the localizing effect of decoherence by an energy gap, causes the pairs to undergo non-picturable, non-geodesic motion in the presence of a gravitational wave. This non-geodesic motion, which is accelerated motion through space, leads to the existence of mass and charge supercurrents inside the superconducting film. On the other hand, the decoherence-induced localizability of the positively charged ions in the lattice causes them to undergo picturable, geodesic motion as they are carried along with space in the presence of the same gravitational wave. The resulting separation of charges leads to a virtual plasma excitation within the film that enormously enhances its interaction with the wave, relative to that of a neutral superfluid or any normal matter. The existence of strong mass supercurrents within a superconducting film in the presence of a gravitational wave, dubbed the “Heisenberg–Coulomb effect,” implies the specular reflection of a gravitational microwave from a film whose thickness is much less than the London penetration depth of the material, in close analogy with the electromagnetic case. The argument is developed by allowing classical gravitational fields, which obey Maxwell-like equations, to interact with quantum matter, which is described using the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) and Ginzburg–Landau theories of superconductivity, as well as a collisionless plasma model. Several possible experimental tests of these ideas, including mesoscopic ones, are presented alongside comments on the broader theoretical implications of the central hypothesis."

abstract="Although experiments carried out by Jain et al. showed that the Cooper pairs obey the strong equivalence principle, The measurement of the Cooper pairs inertial mass by Tate et al. revealed an anomalous excess of mass. In the present paper, we interpret these experimental results in the framework of an electromagnetic model of dark energy for the superconductors' vacuum. We argue that this physical vacuum is associated with a preferred frame. Ultimately from the conservation of energy for Cooper pairs, we derive a model for a variable vacuum speed of light in the superconductors physical vacuum in relation with a possible breaking of the weak equivalence principle for Cooper pairs.",

This allows for the first time to accurately determine the weight of both high-Tc (BSCCO and YBCO) and low-Tc (Nb) superconductors during their phase transition. Our data allow us to put limits on possible weight changes over temperature (α < 2 × 10−8 K−1 for copper) as well as violations of the weak equivalence principle for superconductors while passing their critical temperature (η < 2 × 10−3).}

	abstract = {The lunar laser ranging (LLR) experiment provides precise observations of the lunar orbit that contribute to a wide range of science investigations. In particular, time series of highly accurate measurements of the distance between the Earth and Moon provide unique information that determine whether, in accordance with the equivalence principle (EP), both of these celestial bodies are accelerating toward the Sun at the same rate, despite their different masses, compositions, and gravitational self-energies. Analyses of precise laser ranges to the Moon continue to provide increasingly stringent limits on any violation of the EP. Current LLR solutions give ( − 0.8 ± 1.3) × 10−13 for any possible inequality in the ratios of the gravitational and inertial masses for the Earth and Moon, (mG/mI)E − (mG/mI)M. Such an accurate result allows other tests of gravitational theories. Focusing on the tests of the EP, we discuss the existing data and data analysis techniques. The robustness of the LLR solutions is demonstrated with several different approaches to solutions. Additional high accuracy ranges and improvements in the LLR data analysis model will further advance the research of relativistic gravity in the solar system, and will continue to provide highly accurate tests of the EP.}
